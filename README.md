# wordsearch-generator
Python script for generating wordsearch puzzles

A simple wordsearch generator created as a home learning lockdown project with my son.

You can either add the search words when prompted or execute the script with the argument `wordsearch.py -sw search-words-seperated-by-hyphens`
