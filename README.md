# wordsearch-generator
Python script for generating wordsearch puzzles

A simple wordsearch generator created as a home learning lockdown project with my son. I got him to do a lot of the work, so most of the credit belongs to him. You can learn more about that [here](https://mallaichte.live/projects/2022/03/31/wordsearch.html).

You can either add the search words when prompted or execute the script with the argument `wordsearch.py -sw search-words-seperated-by-hyphens`
